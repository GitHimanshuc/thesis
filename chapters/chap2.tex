\chapter{Introduction to critical Scalar collapse}

In our case we were not so much interested in the behavior of the field close to criticality. What we wanted to understand was how much the scalar field moves during the black hole formation so we can relate it to the swampland distance bound.

\begin{equation}M \simeq k\left(p-p_{*}\right)^{\gamma}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\phi_{*}(r, t)=\phi_{*}\left(e^{\Delta} r, e^{\Delta} t\right)\end{equation}
