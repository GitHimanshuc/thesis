\chapter{Conclusions and Future Directions}

The results that we have got show that there is a sharp tension between two ideas, first that a $O(1)$ scalar field range indicates breakdown of effective field theory and second that an effective field theory should be well-defined at the horizon. Because both these ideas are still neither experimentally verified nor have a sound theoretical "proof", we hope that this extra bit of insight will give us another way of analyzing them.

There are a lot of directions the work done in this thesis can be extended for example, one can look at what happens in the case of a massive scalar field. One can also work with non-canonical kinetic terms or multiple fields, and although we expect that the $O(1)$ field movement will still be there it will be interesting to directly verify it.
This whole study was done under the assumption of spherical symmetry, another way to extend this project will be to do a full 3D evolution of a scalar field without any symmetry assumption.
