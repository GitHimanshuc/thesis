   I would like to thank my advisor Professor Chethan Krishnan for his guidance and constant encouragement. His insights about the problem helped me in avoiding a lot of pitfalls and wasted effort, allowing me to focus on the most important aspects of the problem. I would also like to thank Professor Jun-Qi Guo for answering a lot of questions about the numerical parts of the problem.

   I would also like to thank my family for their continuous support and providing a mental sanctuary away from all the pressure that comes with academia.
   Finally, I would like to thank my friends and batch-mates for all the fruitful discussion that we had about the project and other courses.

\begin{abstract}

   Gravitational collapse of a scalar field is a well studied phenomenon but, most of these studies are focussed on studying the field behavior close to criticality and its implications. In this thesis we revisit the problem of critical collapse but this time in the context of the Swampland bounds.
   We are particularly interested in the Swampland distance bound, according to which a classical solution where scalar fields move by an $O(1)$ range (in Plank units) signals the breakdown of Effective Field Theory.

   In this thesis we show using numerical simulations that, while collapsing into a black hole, a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity can move by $O(1)$ range. This result highlights the sharp tension between the swampland distance bound and the fact that effective field theory should hold at the horizon of a black hole.
   We also show that this $O(1)$ scalar field movement is independent of the initial data by evolving the system with different initial profiles and describe the numerical algorithms used in detail.
